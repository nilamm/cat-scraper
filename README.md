# Cat Scraper
**Cats!**

Cat Scraper is a script that scrapes cat adoption websites for adoptable cats in your area. As I've been exploring adopting a cat myself, I found it difficult to aggregate and compare listings on the the major websites.

Aside from facilitating your cat adoption search, this script could be used to create a dataset around cat adoptions around the country. For instance, running this script daily would create a dataset of daily snapshots of adoptable cats. By noting when a cat became available and then was removed the listing, you could infer an adoption timeline.
